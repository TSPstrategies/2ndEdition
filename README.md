# TSP Investing Strategies, 2nd Edition

This repo provides the scripts, data, and sample graphics cited in 'TSP Investing Strategies: Building Wealth While Working for Uncle Sam", 2nd Edition. 

### Scripts


### Data

I used the interest rate of the 10-year U.S. Government Bond, calculated monthly, as a proxy for the TSP's G Fund. 

I referenced multiple data sets when building the composite index for U.S. stocks, that served as a proxy for the TSP's C Fund. For example, I referenced close prices and monthly returns for the S&P 500, available at https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/^GSPC?p=^GSPC. 

### Sample Graphics

Sample graphics from the 2nd edition are in the Book_Graphics folder.

Additional graphics for reference are kept in Additional_Graphics folder.
